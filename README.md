# CoD FoV Changers

This repository contains the executables of the FoV Changers I made for Call of Duty MW2, MW3, and Ghosts. I am no longer developing them, however if they get broken by a game update, file a new issue and I'll see what I can do.

Source code is not included at the moment, but I may add it later if requested. There is no MW2 SP version and I won't make one, there are plenty of others available, use Google.

### Error fixes

- If you are having issues getting the FoV Changer to work, try waiting until the map is loaded before starting the Changer.

- If you are getting the `System.NullReferenceException` error, simply install Steam you dirty peasant.

- If the FoV Changer has stopped working with [Problem Event Name CLR20r3](https://i.imgur.com/7heWwTW.png), you must [install .NET Framework 3.5](https://www.techhit.com/how-to/install-.net-3.5.1/windows7/).

- If you are getting the `System.ArgumentException Font` error, please download [MissingFonts.zip](https://github.com/AgentRev/CoD-FoV-Changers/raw/master/MissingFonts.zip), and extract the files in `C:\Windows\Fonts` (if asked to replace current files, choose yes).

- No, I don't have FoV Changers for Mac. I don't even have a Mac.
